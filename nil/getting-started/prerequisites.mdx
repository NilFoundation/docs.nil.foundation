# Prerequisites

This page details the steps that need to be completed before working with =nil;.

## Pre-installation

Prior to installing =nil;, it is recommended to install the following:

* Node.js > 18.0.0
* NPM 
* Git
* Hardhat

This will allow for using the entire set of the developer tools provided with =nil; such as the =nil; client library or the =nil; Hardhat plugin.

To install Node.js and NPM via NVM:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
nvm install 20
npm install -g npm
```

To install Git:

```bash
apt-get install git
```

To install Hardhat:

<Tabs groupId='packageSystem'>
  <TabItem value='npm' label='npm'>
    ```bash
    npm install hardhat
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='yarn' label='yarn'>
    ```bash
    yarn add hardhat
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Solidity library

=nil; provides the `Nil.sol` Solidity library that contains several 'helper' functions and function modifiers for working with the cluster.

To access the library:

```bash
```

To access the library, simply import it at the top of any smart contract:

```solidity
import "path/to/Nil.sol";
```

With the library imported, use the `asyncCall()` function in the smart contract code to send a message to another contract deployed either on the same shard or on a different shard. The message will be processed asynchronously: it will spawn a message, and whatever function was called via the message will be executed when the message itself is processed.

To read more about what is included in the Solidity library, [**read this guide**](../tools/sol-library/func-modifiers).

[**Follow this explanation**](../core-concepts/shards-parallel-execution#async-execution) to learn more about the theory behind async execution, or [**complete this tutorial**](./essentials/handling-async-execution) on handling async calls.

## =nil; CLI

The =nil; CLI is an easy-to-use tool for interacting with the cluster from any shell: it supports all major operations and can be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline.

The CLI is distributed as a standalone binary. To install it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/NilFoundation/nil_cli/raw/master/install.sh | bash
```

Initial setup is required for the =nil; CLI to be able to interact with the cluster. [**Learn more about configuring the =nil; CLI.**](../tools/nil-cli/usage)

[**The 'Reference' section**](../reference/cli-reference) contains a full list of commands that can be used via the =nil; CLI.

## Client library

The =nil; client library is a JavaScript module that allows for interating with the cluster using JS classes and functions.

The library can be installed similarly to any other module.


<Tabs groupId='packageSystem'>
  <TabItem value='npm' label='npm'>
    ```bash
    npm install @nilfoundation/niljs
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='yarn' label='yarn'>
    ```bash
    yarn add @nilfoundation/niljs
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Afterward, import the necessary functions and classes from the library:

```js
import { ... } from "@nilfoundation/niljs";
```

[**The 'Reference' section**](../reference/client/index.mdx) contains descriptions of all essential classes and functions.

## Hardhat plugin

=nil; has several features distinguishing it from Ethereum, which means that Hardhat is not natively compatible with the cluster.

However, it is still possible to use Hardhat with =nil; by installing `nil-hardhat-plugin`. This plugin ensures full compatibility between the convenience and familiarity of Hardhat and the unique architecture of =nil;. 

To install the plugin:

<Tabs groupId='packageSystem'>
  <TabItem value='npm' label='npm'>
    ```bash
    npm install @nilfoundation/hardhat-plugin
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='yarn' label='yarn'>
    ```bash
    yarn add @nilfoundation/hardhat-plugin
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info

The =nil; Hardhat plugin only supports sending internal messages from a wallet. It is impossible to send external messages when using this tool.

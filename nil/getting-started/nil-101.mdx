# =nil; 101

This tutorial acts as a 'primer' for working with =nil;. It explains how to perform essential actions with the cluster: creating a new wallet, deploying a contract, and calling a method inside this contract.


## Set up the =nil; CLI

The =nil; CLI is an easy-to-use tool for interacting with the cluster. 

To install the CLI:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/NilFoundation/nil_cli/raw/master/install.sh | bash
```

To generate a new private key and set inside the CLI config:

```bash file=../../tests/nil-101.test.mjs start=startKeygen end=endKeygen
```

To point the CLI toward the RPC endpoint:

```bash file=../../tests/nil-101.test.mjs start=startEndpoint end=endEndpoint
```

## Create a new wallet

In =nil; a wallet is just a smart contract that can handle payments. There are no other structural differences between a wallet and a smart contract, which means that wallets can support any logic that can be expressed inside a smart contract.

### Flow

To create a new wallet:

```bash file=../../tests/nil-101.test.mjs start=startWallet end=endWallet
```

Expected response:

```bash
Contract WALLET_ADDRESS balance is topped up by 100000000
Contract address: WALLET_ADDRESS
```

To check the wallet bytecode:

```bash
nil contract code WALLET_ADDRESS
```

To request a 'top up':

```bash file=../../tests/nil-101.test.mjs start=startTopup end=endTopup
```

To see the wallet address and its public key:

```bash file=../../tests/nil-101.test.mjs start=startInfo end=endInfo
```

## Deploy a smart contract

In =nil; contracts can be deployed on different execution shards that act as separate blockchains. Contracts can communicate with contracts on other shards, avoiding state fragmentation.

Any smart contract deployed in Ethereum-compatible networks and written in Solidity can be redeployed to =nil;

### Flow

Create a new contract containing this code:

```solidity showLineNumbers file=../../tests/Counter.sol start=startContract end=endContract
```

Compile the contract:

```bash file=../../tests/nil-101.test.mjs start=startCompilation end=endCompilation
```

Deploy a contract with the =nil; CLI:

```bash file=../../tests/nil-101.test.mjs start=startDeploy end=endDeploy

```

Expected output:

```bash
Contract address: COUNTER_ADDRESS
Transaction hash: TRANSACTION_HASH (shard 1)
```

Call the `increment()` function:

```bash file=../../tests/nil-101.test.mjs start=startIncrement end=endIncrement
```

Retrieve the result:

```bash file=../../tests/nil-101.test.mjs start=start_CallToIncrementer end=end_CallToIncrementer
```

## Make a cross-shard call

When a smart contract makes a call to another smart contract deployed on a separate shard, the destination shard retrieves the resulting message and processes it. To make thing simpler, the `Nil.sol` library provides the `async_call()` function: it calls a special precompiled contract that allows for easily passing messages between shards.

### Flow

Create a new contract with the following code:


```solidity showLineNumbers file=../../tests/Caller.sol start=startContract end=endContract
```

Compile it and deploy it to Shard 2:

```bash file=../../tests/nil-101.test.mjs start=startCallerCompilation end=endCallerCompilation
```

```bash file=../../tests/nil-101.test.mjs start=start_CallerDeploy end=end_CallerDeploy
```

Expected output:

```bash
Contract address: CALLER_ADDRESS
Transaction hash: TRANSACTION_HASH (shard 1)
```

Note that `CALLER_ADDRESS` starts with `0x0002`, which indicates that `Caller` is indeed deployed on Shard 2.

Send tokens to `Caller` and call the `call()` function:

```bash file=../../tests/nil-101.test.mjs start=start_SendTokensToCaller end=end_SendTokensToCaller
```

```bash file=../../tests/nil-101.test.mjs start=startMessageFromCallerToIncrementer end=endMessageFromCallerToIncrementer
```

Retrieve the result:

```bash file=../../tests/nil-101.test.mjs start=start_CallToIncrementer end=end_CallToIncrementer
```

## Tokens and multi-currency

=nil; has base tokens that are used to pay for essential functionalities such as deploying contracts.

However, each contract can also create a custom currency. A contract can only be the owner of one custom currency. While custom currencies can be transferred between contracts, they cannot be used to pay for operations inside =nil;. 

:::info

Non-owners cannot perform any operations with a custom currency.

### Flow

Create a new wallet:

```bash file=../../tests/nil-101.test.mjs start=startNewWalletDeploy end=endNewWalletDeploy
```

Create a new currency and withdraw it:

```bash file=../../tests/nil-101.test.mjs start=startMintCurrency end=endMintCurrency
```

```bash file=../../tests/nil-101.test.mjs start=startWithdrawCurrency end=endWithdrawCurrency
```

Check the currencies of the wallet:

```bash file=../../tests/nil-101.test.mjs start=startCurrenciesCheck end=endCurrenciesCheck
```

Expected output:

```bash
Contract currencies:
Balance: 50000 CurrencyId=CURRENCY_ID
```

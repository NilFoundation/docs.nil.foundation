# Calling methods inside smart contracts

This tutorial outlines how to interact with [**the tutorial smart contracts**](writing-a-contract.mdx) given the developer tools provided by =nil;.

## Prerequisites

Complete the following tutorials before proceeding.

* [**Writing a contract**](writing-a-contract.mdx)
* [**Deploying a contract**](deploying-a-contract.mdx)

## Using internal messages

### Via the =nil; CLI

To call the `orderProduct()` function inside the retailer contract and trigger an async call:

```bash file=../../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-cli.test.mjs start=startSendTokensCommand end=endSendTokensCommand
```

```bash file=../../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-cli.test.mjs start=startRetailerCallManufacturer end=endRetailerCallManufacturer
```

Make a readonly call to access the value:

```bash file=../../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-cli.test.mjs start=startCallToManufacturerCommand end=endCallToManufacturerCommand
```

The CLI should output the decoded values automatically.

### Via the client library

To send funds to the retailer product and call the `orderProduct` method:

```ts showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-niljs.test.mjs start=startRetailerSendsMessageToManufacturer end=endRetailerSendsMessageToManufacturer
```

To receive and decode the currently created products:

```ts showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-niljs.test.mjs start=startRetailerRetrievesTheResult end=endRetailerRetrievesTheResult 
```

## Using external messages

### Via the =nil; CLI

The CLI currently does not support sending external messages that modify the internal state of smart contracts or spawn internal messages. As a result, sending an external message to a function that performs an async call to another function will fail. 

In the retailer contract, the `orderProduct()` function cannot be called externally as it makes an async call to the manufacturer.

### Via the client library

To order a new product using the retailer:

```ts showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-niljs.test.mjs start=startExternalSendMessageToRetailer end=endExternalSendMessageToRetailer
```

To receive and decode the currently created products:

```ts showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-niljs.test.mjs start=startRetailerRetrievesTheResult end=endRetailerRetrievesTheResult 
```

## Via the Hardhat plugin

Calling smart contract methods via the Hardhat plugin requires creating Hardhat tasks.

Ordering a product from the manufacturer:

```typescript showLineNumbers
import { task } from "hardhat/config";

task("orderProduct", "Orders a product")
  .addParam("retailer", "The address of the Retailer contract")
  .addParam("manufacturer", "The address of the Manufacturer contract")
  .addParam("product", "The name of the product")
  .setAction(async (taskArgs, hre) => {
    const Retailer = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("Retailer");
    const retailer = Retailer.attach(taskArgs.retailer);

    console.log("Ordering the product...");
    const setterTx = await retailer.orderProduct(taskArgs.manufacturer, taskArgs.product);
    await setterTx.wait(0);
  });
```

Retrieving the currently ordered products:

```typescript showLineNumbers
import { task } from "hardhat/config";

task("getProducts", "Gets the current products")
  .addParam("manufacturer", "The address of the Manufacturer contract")
  .setAction(async (taskArgs, hre) => {
    const Manufacturer = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("Manufacturer");
    const manufacturer = Manufacturer.attach(taskArgs.manufacturer);

    console.log("Getting products..");
    const products = await manufacturer.getProducts();

    console.log(products);

  });
```

Execute the following commands to run the newly created tasks:

```bash
npx hardhat orderProduct --manufacturer MANUFACTURER_ADDRESS --retailer RETAILER_ADDRESS --product PRODUCT_NAME --network nil
```

```bash
npx hardhat getProducts --manufacturer MANUFACTURER_ADDRESS --network nil
```

The Hardhat plugin should decode the results of the call and show the new product directly in the terminal.

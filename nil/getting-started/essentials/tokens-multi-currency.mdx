# Tokens and multi-currency support

This tutorial explains how =nil; handles tokens and multi-currency operations.

## Definition

=nil; supplies a basic 'default' currency that is distributed by the `Faucet` contract. 

The network also has a multi-currency mechanism. All accounts (smart contracts) can be paid in any number of arbitrary currencies created either by the account owner or other accounts. Currency creation is dedicated to a special precompiled contract (`Minter`), and anyone can request the creation, minting, and withdrawal of new currencies. 

:::info

While custom currencies can be transferred between accounts, they cannot be used for paying for essential functionalities of =nil; such as deploying contracts or sending async calls.

:::

:::info

When a currency is created, it is assigned an ID derived from the address of the currency owner. A contract can only be the owner of one currency. While non-owners can transfer different currencies between accounts, they cannot mint any currencies that they do not own.

## Usage

### Via the CLI

To create a new currency and withdraw it to the address of the owner:

```bash file=../../../tests/tokens-multi-currency-support.test.mjs start=startBasicCreateCurrencyCommand end=endBasicCreateCurrencyCommand
```

```bash file=../../../tests/tokens-multi-currency-support.test.mjs start=startBasicWithdrawCurrencyCommand end=endBasicWithdrawCurrencyCommand
```

To mint an existing currency (which automatically withdraws it to the owner):

```bash file=../../../tests/tokens-multi-currency-support.test.mjs start=startMintExistingCurrencyCommand end=endMintExistingCurrencyCommand
```

To burn an existing currency (the supply is automatically reduced at the address of the owner):

```bash file=../../../tests/tokens-multi-currency-support.test.mjs start=startBurnExistingCurrencyCommand end=endBurnExistingCurrencyCommand
```

### Via the client library

:::tip

To get the ID of a currency, simply call the `hexToBigInt()` function on the owner's address.

:::

To create a new currency and withdraw it:

```ts file=../../../tests/tokens-multi-currency-support.test.mjs start=startBasicNilJSExample end=endBasicNilJSExample
```

To burn an existing currency:

```ts file=../../../tests/tokens-multi-currency-support.test.mjs start=startNilJSBurningExample end=endNilJSBurningExample
```


## Example

This example creates a wallet that stores three currencies: the default token, and two custom currencies.

### Via the CLI

Create a new wallet:

```bash file=../../../tests/tokens-multi-currency-support.test.mjs start=startWalletCreation end=endWalletCreation
```

Create a new currency with the new wallet as its owner and withdraw it:

```bash file=../../../tests/tokens-multi-currency-support.test.mjs start=startCurrencyOneCreationCommand end=endCurrencyOneCreationCommand
```

```bash file=../../../tests/tokens-multi-currency-support.test.mjs start=startCurrencyOneWithdrawalCommand end=endCurrencyOneWithdrawalCommand
```

Create another currency with another smart contract as its owner:

```bash file=../../../tests/tokens-multi-currency-support.test.mjs start=startCurrencyTwoCreationCommand end=endCurrencyTwoCreationCommand
```

Withdraw the new currency back to the wallet:

```bash file=../../../tests/tokens-multi-currency-support.test.mjs start=startCurrencyTwoWithdrawalCommand end=endCurrencyTwoWithdrawalCommand
```

Check the wallet currencies:

```bash file=../../../tests/tokens-multi-currency-support.test.mjs start=startWalletCurrenciesCommand end=endWalletCurrenciesCommand
```

The following response should appear:

```bash
Contract currencies:
Balance: 50000 CurrencyId=[CURRENCY_ID_ONE]
Balance: 30000 CurrencyId=[CURRENCY_ID_TWO]
```

### Via the client library

Create two new wallets:

```ts showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/tokens-multi-currency-support.test.mjs start=startAdvancedNilJSExample end=endAdvancedNilJSExample
```

Create a new currency for Wallet 1 and withdraw it:

```ts showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/tokens-multi-currency-support.test.mjs start=startAdvancedNilJSMintingExample end=endAdvancedNilJSMintingExample
```

Create a new currency for Wallet 2 and send it to Wallet 1:

```ts showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/tokens-multi-currency-support.test.mjs start=startNilJSTransferExample end=endNilJSTransferExample
```

# Opcode differences between Ethereum and =nil;

=nil; uses the same opcodes with the same signatures as the EVM. However, as =nil; supports cross-shard communications, the actions that some EVM opcodes may perform inside the cluster may differ from their behavior on L1.

The following table contains these opcodes and how they behave in =nil;

| Opcode | Behavior unique to =nil; |
|:--:|:--|
| `CALL`, `STATICCALL`, `DELEGATECALL`, `BALANCE`, `EXTCODECOPY`, `EXTCODEHASH`, `CALLCODE`, `SELFDESTRUCT` | If the input address is not located in the address space of the current execution shard, execution will be reverted. |
| `CALLER`, `ORIGIN` | If processing a messare requires executing these opcodes, and this is the original (first) external call, they return the address of the caller contract. |

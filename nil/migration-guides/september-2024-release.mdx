# Release 03.09.2024: migration guide

The latest release of =nil; introduces several changes to multi-currency support and the minting mechanism.

## Summary of key changes


* The `Minter` contract no longer exists and cannot be called from other smart contracts
* The `Nil.sol` extension library now exposes [**the `awaitCall()` function**](getting-started/essentials/handling-async-execution.mdx##retrieving-values) that allows for making an async call to a smart contract and then awaiting the result
* The JSON-RPC API now includes the `eth_estimateFee` method which can be used for gas estimations. Client tools (`Nil.js` and the =nil; CLI) will support this feature at a later date

## Migration of smart contracts

* Mint currencies directly from wallets

All 'out of the box' wallets provided by =nil; can now mint currencies without having to refer to the `Minter` contract. As a result, the `Minter` contract has been discontinued. Any calls or messages sent to this contract should be removed.

A more detailed overview of how to create currencies via wallets is provided in [**this tutorial**](getting-started/essentials/tokens-multi-currency.mdx).

* Use `NilCurrencyBase` to create custom currencies

Instead of using the now non-existant `Minter` contract, create new custom currencies by deriving contracts from `NilCurrencyBase`:

```solidity showLineNumbers
import "path/to/NilCurrencyBase.sol";

contract Example is NilCurrencyBase {}
```

`NilCurrencyBase` base is a template contract that has all the necessary methods for mimicking the behavior of tokens including minting, currency creation, and attaining the total currency supply.

:::info

Derived contracts can override `virtual` functions inside `NilCurrencyBase` to change the default minting, transferring, or currency creation behaviors.

* Adjust the logic of smart contracts to account for `awaitCall()`

The `awaitCall()` function makes it possible to perform async calls between smart contracts while retrieving the returned value.

If necessary, change the logic of existing smart contracts to use `awaitCall()`.

## Migration of =nil; CLI

No specific changes have to be made to existing =nil; CLI commands.

Note that the `nil wallet call-readonly` command has been added. It allows for performing 'dry runs' of calling contracts via wallet. Provide the `--with-details` flag to see exactly how much fee credit could be spent on performing the operation tested during the 'dry run'.

## Migration of `Nil.js` scripts

* Remove any messages sent to the `Minter` contract

With the latest release, `Nil.js` changes the logic for creating and minting currencies.

To set the currency name:

```js showLineNumbers
{
    const hashMessage = await wallet.setCurrencyName("MY_TOKEN");
    await waitTillCompleted(client, 1, hashMessage);
}

```

To mint the currency and withdraw it to its owner:

```js showLineNumbers
{
    const hashMessage = await wallet.mintCurrency(100_000_000n);
    await waitTillCompleted(client, 1, hashMessage);
}

```

To transfer the currency to another contract:

```js showLineNumbers
await wallet.sendMessage({
    ...
    tokens: [
        {
            id: hexToBigInt(walletAddress),
            amount: AMOUNT
        }
    ]
    ...
});
```

* Adjust function signatures

* The `PublicClient.call()` function no longer expects a `from` argument in its `CallArgs` and accepts `feeCredit`:

```js showLineNumbers
await client.call({
        to: address,
        feeCredit: 500000n,
        abi,
        functionName: "FUNC_NAME",
    }, "latest")
```

* The `waitTillCompleted()` function accepts additional options allowing for waiting until the message with the given hash is included in a block in the main shard:

```js showLineNumbers
await waitTillCompleted(CLIENT, SHARD_ID, HASH, {
    waitTilMainShard: true,
    interval: INTERVAL
}
);
```


## Migration of Hardhat scripts

No specific changes have to be made to existing Hardhat scripts.

# Release 17.09.2024: migration guide

This release of =nil; adds several improvements to developer tools and futher simplifies working with custom currencies.

## Summary of key changes

* The =nil; CLI can now be used to estimate gas
* The cluster supports burning custom currencies
* The `sendRequest()` function in `Nil.sol` supports sending custom currencies
* Whenever a contract fails, logs that have been written prior to the failure point are not reverted. This should make debugging easier

## Migration of smart contracts

* Add custom currencies to `sendRequest()`

The `sendRequest()` function now has one more signature:

```solidity showLineNumbers
function sendRequest(
      address dst,
      uint256 value,
      Token[] memory tokens,
      bytes memory context,
      bytes memory callData
  ) internal {}
```

If the contract logic permits it, attach custom currencies to `sendRequest()`. On the side of the receiving contract, modify the function being called so that it processes the received tokens.

## Migration of the =nil; CLI

* Estimate fees before sending messages

The =nil; CLI now includes the `estimate-fee` command whose purpose is to evaluate how much gas would be spent by sending a specific message.

Use the command as follows:

```bash
nil wallet estimate-fee ADDRESS FUNC_NAME [ARGS] --abi path/to/abi
```

* Burn custom currencies

The CLI also supports burning custom currencies:

```bash
nil minter burn-currency ADDRESS AMOUNT
```

If necessary, add this logic to existing scripts using the =nil; CLI to reduce the total supply of a custom currency.

## Migration of `Nil.js` scripts

* Burn custom currencies

Inside `Nil.js`, `WalletV1` now exposes a new method for burning custom currencies:

```ts showLineNumbers
const amount = 50_000n;
const hashMessage = await wallet.burnCurrency(amount);
await waitTillCompleted(client, 1, hashMessage);
```

Modify existing `Nil.js` scripts to reduce the total supply of custom currencies owned by various wallets.

## Migration of Hardhat scripts

No specific changes have to be made to existing Hardhat scripts.

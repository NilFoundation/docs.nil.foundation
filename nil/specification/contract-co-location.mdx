# Contract placement across shards

## Definition

[**Cross-shard communications**](core-concepts/shards-parallel-execution.mdx#message-passing-checks) are a built-in feature of the =nil; protocol ensuring horizontal scalability with no fragmentation.

However, =nil; makes it possible to request that two accounts are located on the same shard. In this case, interaction between these accounts does not require cross-shard communications.

In plain terms, this request changes the value stored under the account's address in [**the mapping of accounts and shards**](core-concepts/accounts.mdx) stored in the consensus shard. 

:::note[Explanation]

When two contracts (Contract 1 and Contract 2) are placed on the same shards, communications between them can occur synchronously without spawning messages. However, if Contract 1 and Contract 2 are located on different shards, communications between them will always be asynchronous. Async calls between contracts spawn additional messages, and their execution times may vary.

## Scalability considerations

On the one hand, placing contracts on the same shard presents a valuable opportunity for developers wanting to ensure the lowest possible transaction processing times for their users.

On the other hand, this possibility encourages having as many accounts as possible on one shard, undermining the benefits of horizontal scaling.

This concern, however, is mitigated by basic market mechanics: 

* The more accounts exist on the same shard (and the more transactions are submitted by them), the higher the gas price 
* The higher the gas price, the higher the cost of each transaction
* The higher the cost of each transaction, the lower the benefits-to-costs ratio of placign additional accounts on the same shard

It is up to the market participants to determine whether placing contracts on the same shard is worth incurring high transaction costs.

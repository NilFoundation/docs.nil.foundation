# Error handling

This page details how to address the common errors that may be thrown when interacting with =nil;. These errors are either not present in Ethereum or the circumstances when they are thrown differ from Ethereum.

There are two ways the =nil; CLI can display errors:

* As direct responses from the RPC node appearing in the command output
* In message receipts

If an error is thrown by the RPC node, the =nil; CLI will output the error code and the error description:

```bash
failed to send message: rpc error: {"code":-32000,"message":"message status: not replaced"} 
```

If an error is thrown by the cluster, use the `nil receipt HASH --shard-id SHARD_ID` command to see its description in the message receipt:

```json
{
    ...
    "errorMessage": "execution reverted: Insufficient balance"
    ...
}
```

## Message status: not replaced

The `"message status: not replaced"` error is thrown when two messages with the same `seqno` and made to the same contract are sent to the message pool.

To resolve the error:

* When using the CLI manually: retry the operation after several seconds
* When using the CLI in a pipeline or a script: add mandatory delays between CLI commands

## Execution reverted

The `"execution reverted"` error is thrown when the execution of a message encounters an issue and cannot be continued further.

The most probable causes of the error: 

* There is a `require()` statement in a contract that the message data fails to pass
* A function with [**an `onlyInternal` or an `onlyExternal` modifier**](tools/sol-library/func-modifiers.mdx) is called with an incorrect message type
* Any kind of internal contract logic is not being executed correctly
* A message with a non-zero `value` is attempting to call a function not marked as `payable`

To resolve the error:

* Double-check the contract logic and, if possible, remove unnecessary `require()` statements
* Ensure that the correct `FORWARD_KIND` is used in async calls, which should guarantee that contracts can pay [**for chains of two or more async calls**](getting-started/essentials/gas-and-value.mdx)
* Remove `onlyInternal` or `onlyExternal` modifiers and rerun the message chain
* Make sure that messages with a non-zero `value` only call `payable` functions

## Invalid payload

The `"invalid payload"` error is thrown when the message payload cannot be parsed by the RPC node. This usually occurs if the payload has an incorrect size.

To resolve the error:

* Double-check the contract ABI and make sure that the way the message data is encoded matches it

## Failed to pack method call

The `"failed to pack method call"` error is thrown when the message inputs do not match the contract ABI. 

The most probable causes of the error:

* The method that the message is trying to call does not exist
* An incorrect number of arguments is passed in the message
* Arguments of the wrong type are passed in the message

The error will specify the exact reason when it is thrown.

To resolve the error:

* Check that the correct ABI is used in the call
* Look for any typos in the method name that is used in the call
* Ensure that the correct number of arguments are passed in the message
* Change the argument types to match the ABI

## KEY not specified in config

The `"KEY not specified in config" error is thrown when the CLI configuration file lacks one of the following keys:

* `rpc_endpoint`
* `private_key`
* `address`

To resolve the error, execute the following command(s) depending on which key is missing:

```bash file=../../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-cli.test.mjs start=startKeygen end=endKeygen
```

```bash file=../../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-cli.test.mjs start=startWalletCreationCommand end=endWalletCreationCommand
```

```bash file=../../../tests/working-with-smart-contracts-cli.test.mjs start=startEndpoint end=endEndpoint
```

## Out of gas

The `"out of gas"` error is thrown when the message cannot pay for its own execution.

To resolve the error:

* Assign a higher `feeCredit` to the message
* If the error is thrown during a chain of async calls, [**adjust the `FORWARD_KIND` used in the chain**](getting-started/essentials/gas-and-value.mdx)

## Contract address collision

The `"contract address collision"` error is thrown when there is an attempt to deploy a contract to an address that is already occupied.

To resolve the error:

* Pass a different `SALT` to the contract deployment message
* Deploy the contract on a different shard

## External message verification failed

The `"external message verification failed"` error is thrown when an external message cannot pass the verification check in the `verifyExternal()` function of the contract that this message calls. For example, this error appears when attempting to send a message via a wallet while using the wrong keypair for this wallet.

To resolve this error:

* Double-check the contents of the =nil; CLI config file and ensure that the file contains the correct private key
* Check the verification logic inside the `verifyExternal()` function of the contract being called and adjust the message accordingly

## Attempt to deploy to main shard from non-system wallet

The `"attempt to deploy to main shard from non-system wallet"` error is thrown when a smart contract makes a deploy request to the main shard. Deployments to the main shard are prohibited.

To resolve the error:

* Specify a different `--shard-id` when making the deployment request

## Message fee forwarding failed

The `"message fee forwarding failed"` error is thrown when there is an issue with [**gas forwarding**](getting-started/essentials/gas-and-value.mdx) across several contracts.

To resolve the error:

* Trace the chain of async calls and, if necessary, change the `FORWARD_KIND` used in the contracts being called
* Increase the `feeCredit` used in async call chains

# =nil; CLI usage

There are several steps that need to be completed before using the =nil; CLI.

## Create a new config file

To create a config file for the =nil; CLI:

```bash
nil config init
```

## Set the RPC endpoint

Initially, the =nil; CLI is unaware of the RPC endpoint for interacting with the cluster.

To set the RPC endpoint:

```bash
nil config set rpc_endpoint NIL_ENDPOINT
```

## Create a new private key

Creating a new private key is the next logical step before creating a new wallet.

```bash
nil keygen new
```

## Create a new wallet

At this point, the only remaining action is to create a new wallet:

```bash
nil wallet new
```

After running this command, the =nil; CLI should be fully ready to interact with the cluster.

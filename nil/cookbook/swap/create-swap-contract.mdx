# Create the swap contract

The swap contract needs to do the following:

* Accept swap requests
* Match swap requests and exchange tokens
* Handle excess tokens and send them back to wallets located on different shards

## Contract definition

```solidity showLineNumbers

pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

import "@nilfoundation/smart-contracts/contracts/Nil.sol";

/**
 * @title SwapMatch
 * @author =nil; Foundation
 * @notice The contract matches swap requests and performs token swaps.
 * On a successful match, the desired tokens are sent to the swap originators.
 * The contract also calculates token excesses and sends them back on a successful match.
 */
contract SwapMatch is NilBase {}
```

## Structs and properties

The contract contains the following structs and properties:

```solidity showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/SwapMatch.sol start=startContractStructsAndProperties end=endContractStructsAndProperties
```

* The `Swap` struct stores data about a token exchange that has been processed successfuly. It shows both parties that participated in the swap as well as information about the associated tokens
* The `SwapRequest` struct represents a single request for a token exchange coming from one wallet (`initiator`). It contains the token the wallet wants to exchange as well as the ID of the desired token and its amount
* The `swaps` and `swapRequests` maps store recorded swaps and swap requests using the current counter values as keys

## Contract events

The contract emits the following events

```solidity showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/SwapMatch.sol start=startContractEvents end=endContractEvents
```

## Placing swap requests

Wallets can place new swap requests by calling this function:

```solidity showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/SwapMatch.sol start=startPlaceSwapRequest end=endPlaceSwapRequest
```

The function initializes a new `SwapRequest` and increases the swap request counter. It also starts the matching process.

## Matching swap requests

The contract matches swap requests using this function:

```solidity showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/SwapMatch.sol start=startMatchSwapRequests end=endMatchSwapRequests
```

The function iterates over all recorded swap requests and finds a suitable partner for the new swap request. This is done based on four conditions:

* The 'candidate' swap request must not be matched yet
* The 'candidate' swap request must contain at least the same amount of tokens as desired in the swap request being matched
* The 'candidate' swap request is asking for the same token as provided in the swap request being matched
* The swap request being matched can provide at least the same amount of tokens as desired by the 'candidate' swap request

If all conditions are satisfied, the contract begins sending tokens. It also initializes a new `Swap` object and updates the relevant map and counter. 

## Sending tokens and handling excesses

The contract sends tokens and makes sure that both parties in a swap receive back any 'excess' tokens that could not be exchanged:

```solidity showLineNumbers file=../../../tests/SwapMatch.sol start=startSendTokensAndProcessExcess end=endSendTokensAndProcessExcess
```

The function calculates the possible token excesses:

* The difference between the amount of tokens desired by the matched swap request and the new swap request
* The difference between the amount of tokens desired by the new swap request and the matched swap request

The tokens are transformed into token arrays and sent to the originators of swap requests using `Nil.asyncCall()`. All refunds are also sent to these addresses.

# Writing a simple circuit

This tutorial describes how to create a simple circuit and use elliptic curve fields.

:::tip

The C++ examples in this tutorial and across the rest of the documentation use types and algorithms from [**the `crypto3` library**](https://github.com/NilFoundation/crypto3).

The Rust examples use types from the forks of [**the `arkwors-rs algebra` project**](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/algebra).

- [**`arkworks-algebra`**](https://github.com/NilFoundation/arkworks-algebra.git)
- [**`arkworks-curves`**](https://github.com/NilFoundation/arkworks-curves.git)

## Multiplication example

Any circuit is a series of polynomials which, in the case of high-level programming languages, can be expressed as a function.

For zkLLVM to correctly recognise a function as a circuit, it needs to be preceeded by the following directive.

<Tabs groupId='language'>
  <TabItem value='cpp' label='C++'>

    ```cpp
    [[circuit]]
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value='rust' label='Rust'>

    ```rust
    #[circuit]
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

A simple example of a circuit with one multiplication operator would look as follows.

<Tabs groupId='language'>
  <TabItem value='cpp' label='C++'>

    ```cpp

    [[circuit]] int multiplication_example(
    int a,
    int b) {
      auto c = a*b;
      return c;
    }

    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value='rust' label='Rust'>

    ```rust
    #[circuit]
    pub fn multiplication_example(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
      let c = a * b;
      c
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info[Using standard types in C++]

The compiler supports several types from the `std` library such as `int` and `long`.

Note that `clang` presently does not support `std::string` and several other types from `std`.

:::

The function takes two variables, multiplies them, and returns the result. With no additional code needed, it is a fully-fledged circle.

:::warning

Only one function in a project can be preceeded by the `[[circuit]]`/`#[circuit]` annotation.

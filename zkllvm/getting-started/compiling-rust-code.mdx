# Compiling Rust code

This tutorial demonstrates how an `.rs` file can be converted into a circuit IR.

The flow for compiling Rust code is similar to compiling any other `cargo` project. The only notable difference is specifying a different build target for `cargo` while the rest of the Rust developer experience remains the same. 

## Using `cargo` from a pre-built binary

If `cargo` has been [**installed from a pre-built binary**](./installation#using-pre-built-binaries), run the following command. 

```bash
cargo +zkllvm build --target assigner-unknown-unknown --release
```

After the build procedure is complete, the resulting `.ll` file will appear in the `./target/assigner-unknown-unknown/release` directory. The file will have the same name as the name of the current `cargo` crate. 

## Using `cargo` from sources

If `cargo` has been [**installed from sources**](./installation#building-from-sources), export the `RUSTC` and `CARGO` environmental variables.

```bash
export CARGO="path/to/cargo"
export RUSTC="path/to/rustc"
```

`cargo` should be located in `"/zkllvm/build/libs/rslang/build/host/stage2-tools-bin/cargo"`. 

`rustc` should be located in `"zkllvm/build/libs/rslang/build/host/stage2/bin"`.

Then, execute the following command.

```bash
RUSTC=$RUSTC $CARGO build --target assigner-unknown-unknown --release
```

The resulting `.ll` file should be located in the `./target/assigner-unknown-unknown/release` folder. 

## Using `rustc` directly

While using `rustc` instead of `cargo` is unconventional, it is still possible to call the compiler directly to produce `.ll` files.

If `rustc` has been installed as from a pre-built binary, run this command.  

```bash
rustc +zkllvm --target assigner-unknown-unknown --emit=llvm-ir path/to/circuit.rs -C opt-level=3
```

If `rustc` has been installed from sources, execute the following command. 

```bash
$RUSTC --target assigner-unknown-unknown --emit=llvm-ir path/to/circuit.rs -C opt-level=3
```

:::tip

The `-C opt-level=3` option is needed to build the circuit into an IR that is most compatible with `assigner`. If it is ommitted, the IR will contain additional verbose code which may hinder `assigner` from generating constraints and the assignment table.

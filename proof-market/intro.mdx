# `=nil;` Proof Market

## Introduction

Proof Market is a marketplace of zero-knowledge proofs.

Zero-knowledge proofs are powerful but generating them is a compute-heavy task. Proof Market offers an alternative: anyone can post a request for a specific proof and procure said proof after it is generated by a designated producer.

For proof requesters, Proof Market eliminates the traditional overheads associated with creating a proof. For proof producers, Proof Market is a valuable tool that offers incentives for proof generation.

Proof Market functions as a REST API whose endpoints can be consumed from any suitable interface.

:::info

Proof Market is currently centralised, meaning that each published proof needs to be verified by =nil; Foundation. Decentralising Proof Market is planned in a future update.

:::info

Proof Market accepts circuits generated using [**the zkLLVM compiler**](../zkllvm/overview/what-is-zkllvm) and based on the [**Placeholder**](https://github.com/NilFoundation/evm-placeholder-verification) PLONK-ish proof system.

Other arithmetizations (e.g., AIR or R1CS) will be supported in future updates to Proof Market.

## Basic usage flow

Using Proof Market can be condensed in just six steps.

1. Users and proof producers authorize inside Proof Market using their Metamask wallets
2. Optionally, application developers [**create new arithmetic circuits**](./application-developers/tutorials/writing-new-circuit) and [**post new statements**](./application-developers/tutorials/managing-statements) containing these circuits on Proof Market
3. Users [**post new requests**](./application-developers/tutorials/managing-requests) for proving a statement given a certain public input; these requests include the price the user is willing to pay for a proof
4. Proof producers [**post new proposals**](./proof-producers/tutorials/managing-proposals) for generating proofs; these proposals include the reward the proof producer wants to receive for their efforts
5. Proof Market matches users' requests with proof producers' proposals
6. Proof producers submit valid proofs and [**receive compensation**](./proof-producers/tutorials/managing-incentives) which is taken from users' wallets

# `=nil;` Proof Market

## Introduction

<GitHubButton Url='https://github.com/NilFoundation/proof-market-toolchain' />

Proof Market is a marketplace of zero-knowledge proofs.

Zero-knowledge proofs are powerful but generating them is a compute-heavy task. Proof Market offers an alternative: anyone can post a request for a specific proof and procure said proof after it is generated by a designated producer. In turn, a proof producer can sell ready-made proofs that they have generated previously. 

For proof requesters, Proof Market eliminates the traditional overheads associated with creating a proof. For proof producers, Proof Market is a valuable monetization tool that provides access network of customers.

:::info

Proof Market is currently centralised, meaning that each published product needs to be approved by =nil; Foundation. Decentralising Proof Market is planned in a future update.

:::info

Proof Market accepts circuits generated using [**the zkLLVM compiler**](../zkllvm/overview/what-is-zkllvm) and based on the [**Placeholder**](https://github.com/NilFoundation/evm-placeholder-verification) PLONK-ish proof system.

Other arithmetizations (e.g., AIR or R1CS) will be supported in future updates to Proof Market.

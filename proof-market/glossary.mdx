# Glossary

This page defines the key terms used in Proof Market. 

## Circuit

A circuit is an algebraic representation of an algorithm consisting of a series of polynomial equations. 

The [**zkLLVM compiler**](../zkllvm/overview/what-is-zkllvm) allows anyone to write a circuit in either C++ or Rust. Circuit code can be compiled into an intermediate representation (IR) in `.ll` format, which can then be used to generate a statement.

Note that a circuit is typically provided by a proof requester.

## Statement

A statement is the primary object of trade in Proof Market.

A statement contains a circuit and additional metadata for trading. To publish a statement, create a [**circuit IR**](../zkllvm/getting-started/compiling-a-circuit), and [**perform an API request**](./application-developers/tutorials/managing-statements).

Similarly to circuits, statements are typically generated by proof requesters. 

## Proof requester

An entity (an application or a user) that wants to use zero-knowledge proofs to verify something on the blockhain.

## Proof producer

A Proof Market participant to whom the proof requester wants to deletage proof production. Proof producers are tasked with generating proofs in response to open requests and submitting these proofs to requesters.

:::tip[Requirements]

There are no specific requirements for becoming a proof producer. This role can be filled by anyone with spare bandwith and sufficiently strong hardware.

:::

## Proposal

A proposal is an offer made by a proof producer to generate a proof for a specific statement and for a specific price.

## Request

A request is a formalized call to generate a proof for a specific statement with given public inputs and for a specific reward. Whenever public inputs change, a new request has to be posted.

:::info[Request statuses]

A request may have the following statuses.

* `CREATED`: the initial status for any request before it is matched with a proposal.
* `PENDING`: the status assigned after a request is matched with a proposal. At this stage, Proof Market awaits a proof producer to generate a proof.
* `DONE`: the final status for any successful request. It is assigned after proof is provided by a proof producer.
* `ERROR`: the final status for an unsuccessful request. It is assigned for any reason that causes a request to fail.

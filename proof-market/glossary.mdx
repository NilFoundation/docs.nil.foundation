# Glossary

This page defines the key terms used in Proof Market. 

## Circuit

A circuit is an algebraic representation of an algorithm consisting of a series of polynomial equations. 

The [**zkLLVM compiler**](../zkllvm/overview/what-is-zkllvm) allows anyone to write a circuit in either C++ or Rust. Circuit code can be compiled into an intermediate representation (IR) in `.ll` format, which can then be used to generate a statement.

Note that a circuit is typically provided by a proof requester.

## Statement

A statement is the primary object of trade in Proof Market.

A statement contains a circuit and additional metadata for trading. To publish a statement, create a [**circuit IR**](../zkllvm/getting-started/compiling-a-circuit), attach metadata, and perform an API request.

Similarly to circuits, statements are typically generated by proof requesters. 

## Proof requester

An entity (either digital or physical) that wants to use zero-knowledge proofs in its activities such as cross-cluster operations.

## Proof producer

A Proof Market participant that allocates resources for producing the proofs asked for by proof producers.

## Proposal

A proposal is an offer made by a proof producer to generate proof for a specific statement.

## Request

A request is an ask made to generate a proof for a specific statement and with given public inputs. Whenever public inputs change, a new request has to be posted.

:::info[Request statuses]

A request may have the following statuses.

* `CREATED`: the initial status for any request before it is matched with a proposal.
* `PENDING`: the status assigned after a request is matched with a proposal. At this stage, Proof Market awaits a proof producer to generate proof.
* `DONE`: he final status for any successful request. It is assigned after proof is provided by a proof producer.

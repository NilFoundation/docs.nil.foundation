# Glossary

This page defines the key terms used in Proof Market. 

## Circuit

A circuit is an algebraic representation of an algorithm consisting of a series of polynomial equations. 

The [**zkLLVM compiler**](../zkllvm/overview/what-is-zkllvm) allows anyone to write a circuit in either C++ or Rust. Circuit code can be compiled into an intermediate representation (IR) in `.ll` format, which can then be used to generate a statement.

## Order

An order is a call for a specific proof made by a proof requester. 

## Statement

A statement is the primary object of trade in Proof Market.

A statement contains a circuit and additional metadata for trading. To publish a statement, create a [**circuit IR**](../zkllvm/getting-started/compiling-a-circuit), attach metadata, and perform an API request.

## Proof requester

An entity (either digital or physical) that wants to use zero-knowledge proofs in its activities such as cross-cluster operations.

## Proof producer

A Proof Market participant that allocates resources for producing the proofs asked for by proof producers.

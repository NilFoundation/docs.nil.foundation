# Proof producers

## Introduction

Proof producers generate and submit proofs in response to open requests. By taking on the costs of proof generation, proof producers earn monetary rewards for completed orders.

:::info[Example]

Imagine a zero-knowledge chess club dApp where player records are stored on the blockchain.

Each time a match finishes, the app requests a new zero-knowledge proof to convince the blockchain that the match really happened and its results are valid.

By generating new proofs for these requests, the proof producer reliably earns compensation.

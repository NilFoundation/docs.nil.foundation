# Proof producers

## Introduction

Proof producers generate and submit proofs in response to open requests. By taking on the costs of proof generation, proof producers earn monetary rewards for completed orders.

Proof Market offers [**an easy-to-use REST API**](../api-reference). Here is the basic flow of using it as a proof producer.

1. [**Authorize inside Proof Market**](./tutorials/registering-new-producer) as a proof producer
2. [**Check for available statements**](./tutorials/managing-proposals)
3. [**Post a new proposal**](./tutorials/managing-proposals) for the chosen statement
4. Wait for Proof Market to match your proposal with a request
5. [**Generate a proof**](../../zkllvm/getting-started/verifying-a-circuit) for the circuit contained in the statement
6. [**Receive a reward**](./tutorials/managing-incentives) for the generated proof


:::info[Example]

Imagine a zero-knowledge chess club dApp where player records are stored on the blockchain.

Each time a match finishes, the app requests a new zero-knowledge proof to convince the blockchain that the match really happened and its results are valid.

By generating new proofs for these requests, the proof producer reliably earns compensation.

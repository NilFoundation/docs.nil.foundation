# Managing proposals

This tutorial covers the essential steps for handling proposals as a proof producer.

## Definition

A proposal is a formal claim that a proof producer is willing to generate proof for a statement for a particular price.

Proof producers can post proposals in response to existing requests or in anticipation of future requests. Whenever there are proposals and requests for a statement, Proof Market runs a matching process. After a proposal is matched with a statement, the proof producer can proceed with generating proof.

:::info

Each proposal has a `"waitingDurationSeconds"` property set by the proof producer. If the matching process exceeds the number of seconds specified under this property, matching is canceled and the proposal needs to be recreated.

## Creating a new proposal

Send a [**`POST` request to `/proposal`**](../../api-reference#operation/CreateProposal) to create a new proposal.

<ApiSchema pointer='#/components/schemas/CreateProposalRequest'/>

This call should produce the below response.

<ApiSchema pointer='#/components/schemas/ProposalItem'/>

## Checking for matched requests

As the matching process is ongoing, make [**periodic calls to `/book/assigned`**](../../api-reference#operation/Assigned) to get a list of `BookAssignedItem` objects.

<ApiSchema pointer='#/components/schemas/BookAssignedItem'/>

A `BookAssignedItem` object represents an agreed-upon opportunity to generate a proof. It contains the circuit inputs under the `"input"` key.

To attain the corresponding statement with the circuit definition, perform [**a `GET` request to `/statement/{statementId}`**](../../api-reference#operation/GetById).

## Submitting the proof

After [**generating the proof**](../../../zkllvm/getting-started/verifying-a-circuit), send [**a `POST` call to `/proof`**](../../api-reference#operation/SubmitProof) with this request body:

<ApiSchema pointer='#/components/schemas/SubmitProofRequest'/>

This will produce the following response.

<ApiSchema pointer='#/components/schemas/ProofItem'/>

Note that Proof Market validates all submitted proofs. If a submitted proof is invalid, the user would need to send another request while the proof producer would need to send a new proposal.

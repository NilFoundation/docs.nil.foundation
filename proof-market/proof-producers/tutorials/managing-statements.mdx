# Managing statements

This tutorial explains what statements are and how they can be used by proof producers.

## Definition

Statements are circuits with additional metadata such as a name and an ID.

The primary purpose of statements is to 'wrap' circuits inside a tradeable entity that can be used to match proof requesters and proof producers. 

## Attaining available statements

Regularly check the list of available statements to see new opportunities for offering proof generation services.

To do so, send a [**`GET` request to `/statement`**](../../api-reference#operation/GetByFilter), which should return a list of `StatementItem` objects.

<ApiSchema pointer="#/components/schemas/StatementItem"/>

## Accessing statement statistics

After selecting a statement, attain statistics about the requests made by application developers and the proposals made by proof producers.

Perform a [**`GET` request to `/book/{statementId}`**](../../api-reference#operation/StatementBook) to produce the below response.

<ApiSchema pointer="#/components/schemas/StatementBook"/>

The information in the statement book should be used when setting the price of subsequent proposals.

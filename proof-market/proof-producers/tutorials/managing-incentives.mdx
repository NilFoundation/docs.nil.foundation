# Managing incentives

This tutorial explains how proof producers can receive compensation for successfully completed proposals. The general flow is as follows:

* An application stakes the Proof Market contract at the user's request
* Whenever an application needs to pay for a proof, the contract automatically handles the payment between the requester and the producer

## Contract details

Proof Market exists as a contract that can be called from any suitable environment. 

To attain the network and the deposit address of the contract, perform a [**`POST` request to `/system/info`**](../../api-reference#operation/SystemInfo). This should produce the following response.

<ApiSchema pointer="#/components/schemas/SystemInfo"/>

The contract stores the addresses of Proof Market users (including proof requesters and proof producers) in the `balances` mapping.

The contract has three public functions for handling payments.

- `function deposit() public payable {}`
- `function withdraw(address payable user, uint256 amount) public`
- `function transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public`

The code of the Proof Market smart contract [**can be accessed here**](https://github.com/NilFoundation/proof-market-contracts/blob/master/contracts/proof-market-cent.sol).

## Receiving rewards

The user must stake the Proof Market contract before requesting a proof.

Whenever a valid proof is submitted and verified, the Proof Market contract automatically calls the `transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount)` function to send a reward to the proof producer.

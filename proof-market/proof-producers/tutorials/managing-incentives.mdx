# Managing incentives

This tutorial explains how proof producers can receive compensation for successfully completed proposals.

## Contract details

Proof Market exists as a contract that can be called from any suitable environment. 

To attain the network and the deposit address of the contract, perform a [**`POST` request to `/system/info`**](../../api-reference#operation/SystemInfo). This should produce the following response.

<ApiSchema pointer="#/components/schemas/SystemInfo"/>

The contract stores the addresses of Proof Market users (including proof requesters and proof producers) in the `balances` mapping.

The contract has three public functions for handling payments.

- `function deposit() public payable {}`
- `function withdraw(address payable user, uint256 amount) public`
- `function transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public`

## Receiving rewards

Whenever a valid proof is submitted and verified, the proof requester calls the `transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount)` function to send a reward to the proof producer.

As Metamask is used to authorize inside Proof Market, no additional actions are required on the part of the proof producer.

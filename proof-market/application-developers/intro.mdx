# Application developers

## Introduction

Application developers create dApps whose users can verify something on the blockchain by requesting proofs via Proof Market.

Proof Market functions as a simple REST API. The basic flow of using it is as follows.

1. [**Authorize the user inside Proof Market**](./tutorials/signing-up)
2. [**Use circuits**](./tutorials/writing-new-circuit) inside an application (and optionally [**verify the circuit proofs**](./tutorials/verifying-a-circuit))
3. [**Use statements**](./tutorials/managing-statements) to represent changes that the user wants to verify

:::info[Statements]

A [**statement**](../glossary.mdx#statement) represents a circuit, its inputs and additional metadata.

Whenever a user completes an action inside an app that requires verification, a new set of inputs is produced for the corresponding circuit. This necessitates generating a new statement and a corresponding request for attaining proof.

:::

4. [**Post requests**](./tutorials/managing-requests) for proofs whenever the user asks to verify their actions
5. [**Ensure payment for generated proofs**](./tutorials/managing-payments)

:::info[Example]

Imagine a developer of a decentralized chess club app where player records are stored on the blockchain and verification occurs via zero-knowledge proofs.

Every time a player wins or loses a match, the app would need to spend significant resources to generate proof that the player record change is valid.

Instead, the app can request the necessary proof via the [**Proof Market API**](../api-reference) and update player records as soon as the correct proof is provided by the designated proof producer.

:::

Note that using Proof Market as an application developer requires some familiarity with either C++ or Rust, and [**the zkLLVM compiler**](../../zkllvm/overview/what-is-zkllvm). This is needed for writing new circuits, converting them into intermediate representations, and using these representations for on-chain and off-chain verification.

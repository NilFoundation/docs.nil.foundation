# Application developers

## Introduction

Application developers create dApps whose users can verify something on the blockchain by requesting proofs via Proof Market.

Proof Market functions as a simple REST API. The basic flow of using it is as follows.

1. [**Authorize the user inside Proof Market**](./tutorials/signing-up)
2. [**Use circuits**](./tutorials/writing-new-circuit) for in-app use cases that require verification (and optionally [**verify their proofs**](./tutorials/verifying-a-circuit))
3. [**Use existing and new statements**](./tutorials/managing-statements) to request circuit proofs

:::info[Reusing circuits and statements]

Writing circuits and creating statements for them from scratch is not necessary. An app can reuse statements posted on Proof Market by other developers. 

:::

4. [**Post requests**](./tutorials/managing-requests) for proofs
5. [**Ensure payment for generated proofs**](./tutorials/managing-payments)

:::info[Example]

Imagine a developer of a decentralized chess club app where player records are stored on the blockchain and verification occurs via zero-knowledge proofs.

Every time a player wins or loses a match, the app would need to spend significant resources to generate proof that the player record change is valid.

Instead, the app can request the necessary proof via the [**Proof Market API**](../api-reference) and update player records as soon as the correct proof is provided by the designated proof producer.

Note that using Proof Market as an application developer requires some familiarity with either C++ or Rust, and [**the zkLLVM compiler**](../../zkllvm/overview/what-is-zkllvm).

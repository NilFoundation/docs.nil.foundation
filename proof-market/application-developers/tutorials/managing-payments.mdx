# Managing payments 

This tutorial details how Proof Market handles payments.

## Attaining contract details

Proof Market exists as a contract that can be called from any application. 

To attain the network and the deposit address of the contract, perform a [**`POST` request to `/system/info`**](../../api-reference#operation/SystemInfo). This should produce the following response.

<ApiSchema pointer="#/components/schemas/SystemInfo"/>

The contract stores the addresses of Proof Market users (including proof requesters and proof producers) in the `balances` mapping.

The contract has three public functions for handling payments.

- `function deposit() public payable {}`
- `function withdraw(address payable user, uint256 amount) public`
- `function transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public`

## Paying for proofs

To pay for a generated proof, simply call the `transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount)` function inside an application.

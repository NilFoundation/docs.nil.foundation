# Verifying a proof

This tutorial demonstrates how [**the initial circuit**](./writing-new-circuit) can be verified on-chain and off-chain.

Regardless of whether verification is done on-chain or off-chain, a circuit needs to be accompanied by a public inputs file.

## Creating a public inputs file

Create a new `.inp` file and copy-paste the following JSON array inside it.

```json
[{ "int": 5 }, { "int": 11 }]
```

The circuit function in the tutorial circuit accepts two integers the values of which are taken from the `.inp` file.

## On-chain verification

### Meeting the prerequisites

In-EVM verification is done via the [**EVM Placeholder proof system verifier**](https://github.com/NilFoundation/evm-placeholder-verification).

To install it, install Node.js and `npm`. Afterward, run the following commands.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NilFoundation/evm-placeholder-verification.git
cd evm-placeholder-verification/
npm install
npx hardhat compile
```

### Creating the proof

At this stage, the circuit IR needs to be passed to the `assigner` tool which will generate the circuit constraints and the assignment table.

```bash
assigner -b -i path/to/input.inp -c circuit.crct -t assignment.tbl -e pallas --generate-type circuit-assignment path/to/circuit.ll
```

Afterward, run the `transpiler` tool on the newly generated `.crct` and `.tbl` files. This tool will produce a binary with the proof as well as Solidity contracts for the circuit.

```bash
transpiler -m gen-evm-verifier -c path/to/circuit.crct -t path/to/assignment.tbl -o output -e pallas --optimize-gates
```

The `.output` directory should contain all files necessary for proof verification.

### Validating the proof

To validate the proof, copy and paste the `./output` folder into the `path/to/evm-placeholder-verification/contracts/zkllvm` directory.

Afterward, navigate to this directory and run the below command. 

```bash
npx hardhat deploy
```
This will deploy all circuits in the ./evm-placeholder-verification/contracts/** directory including the new circuit to a local EVM network.

Verify the proof:

```bash
npx hardhat verify-circuit-proof --test path/to/output
```

, where the last argument is the path to the `./output` directory created after running the `transpiler` tool.

The terminal should display the following output.

```bash
Run modular verifier for: path/to/output
Verify : ../contracts/zkllvm/path/to/output/proof.bin

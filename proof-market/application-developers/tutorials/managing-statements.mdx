# Managing statements

This tutorial explains what statements are and their role in application development.

## Definition

Statements are circuits with additional metadata such as a name and an ID.

The primary purpose of statements is to 'wrap' circuits inside a tradeable entity that can be used to match proof requesters and proof producers. 

## Attaining available statements

If reusing an existing circuit is sufficient for the app, check the list of available statements to see whether there exist ready-made statements.

To do so, send a [**`GET` request to `/statement`**](../../api-reference#operation/GetByFilter), which should return a list of `StatementItem` objects.

<ApiSchema pointer="#/components/schemas/StatementItem"/>

If there is no need to create a new statement, skip the next step.

## Creating a new statement (Optional)

To create a new statement, perform a [**`POST` request to `/statement`**](../../api-reference#operation/CreateStatement) with the following request body.

<ApiSchema pointer="#/components/schemas/CreateStatementRequest"/>

The response will contain a newly generated `StatementItem` object.

:::tip[Circuit inputs]

When creating a new statement, specify circuit inputs in the `"input_description"` key as a sequence of values and types separated by spaces. Consider these examples.

- `2 int 5 int`
- `10 field 98 int`

## Accessing statement statistics

After selecting an existing statement or creating a new one, the app must attain statistics about the requests made by other users and the proposals made by proof producers.

Perform a [**`GET` request to `/book/{statementId}`**](../../api-reference#operation/StatementBook) to produce the below response.

<ApiSchema pointer="#/components/schemas/StatementBook"/>

## Attaining user balance (Optional)

Optionally, the app may also request information about the user's balance to evaluate whether the user can pay for requesting a proof.

Send a [**`GET` request to `/user/info`**](../../api-reference#operation/UserDetails) and receive this response:

<ApiSchema pointer="#/components/schemas/UserDetails"/>

The `"balance"` key should contain information about the user's remaining funds.
